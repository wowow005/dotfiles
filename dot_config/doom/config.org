Setting up the config to find the Org and Org Roam directories.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

;; change `org-directory'. It must be set before org loads!
(setq org-directory "~/MEGA/org/"
      org-roam-directory "~/MEGA/org/references/notes")

;; This determines the style of line numbers in effect. If set to `nil', line
;; numbers are disabled. For relative line numbers, set this to `relative'.
(setq display-line-numbers-type t)

;; Here are some additional functions/macros that could help you configure Doom:
;;
;; - `load!' for loading external *.el files relative to this one
;; - `use-package!' for configuring packages
;; - `after!' for running code after a package has loaded
;; - `add-load-path!' for adding directories to the `load-path', relative to
